                The Groundwater of the given area was generally weakly alkaline with pH ranging from
                7.8 to 8.5.
                Cl- and HCO3- are the major anions and Ca2+ and Mg2+ are the major cations.
                The relative
abundance of the ions(on molar basis) is in the order ofand .
                The chloride value in the study area ranges between 49.63 and 753.7 mg/l. The occurrences of sulfate ions in the investigated water could be due to sedimentary rocks such as gypsum (CaSO4, 2H2O) and
                anhydrite (CaSO4). Further addition of sulfates to the groundwater might have come from the breakdown of
                organic matters in the soil, and from addition of leachable sulfates in fertilizers of the intensively cultivated areas.
                As the SAR ,it means Sodium Hazard on Water is low so use on sodium sensitive crops must be cautioned    </Typography>
